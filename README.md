# RiptideLab

Building functionality for our glorious MTG Cube forum: https://riptidelab.com/forum/. Mainly we want to nicely display Magic cards and decks in forum posts. We already have code that does this, but there are APIs to take advantage of and features to add.

Also, I'm currently taking a break from work and aiming to improve myself as a programmer. Feedback welcome!
